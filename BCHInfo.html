      <h2>What is Bitcoin Cash?</h2>
      <p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that was created as a result of a hard fork from the original Bitcoin blockchain. It was launched on August 1, 2017, with the aim of addressing some of the scalability issues faced by Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin Cash has a larger block size limit compared to Bitcoin, allowing more transactions to be processed in each block. This makes it faster and cheaper to use for day-to-day transactions.</p>
      <p>Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash uses a decentralized ledger called the blockchain to keep track of all transactions. Transactions are validated by nodes on the network and added to the blockchain in a secure and transparent manner.</p>
